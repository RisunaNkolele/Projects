 don’t know what to call the  project yet
An approach for medication distribution in hospitals and clinics.


Problem statement
Some hospitals and clinics, especially in rural areas, experience a shortage of medication. There are issues related to the shortage of medication, sometimes, as a result, patients develop new underlying diseases due to inconsistency in medication-taking and sometimes it results in death.

Aim
Come up with an approach that will suggest the amount of medication the government should distribute for certain area monthly (This should check for all possible patient admission)
Data
-The population of the area
-Sample (Hospitals keeps a record of patients who come to the clinic monthly (those with chronic diseases- they have to go and get medication every month)
This number of people is given or at least approximated – coz well certain people sometimes miss their appointment
-They record the medication they give to the patient (Remember those with chronic diseases- the medication they take it doesn’t change (They have the record of the kind and dosage of medication one should have based on their disease), but sometimes due to shortage of medication they don’t get all the medication).

Getting the data process:
-we have to apply for ethics for a certain ward
- this might take long given that now the health department is focusing on Corona
- I will be keeping you updated every week
Approach
-We will decide once we see the structure of the data (but my bet is that we might have to use NLP and something- given that in healthcare they use narrative text)
In the meantime:
-One can create the GitHub repo and invite us using our emails
-we can try to find something similar to this (dataset)
